my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 'a'  # Change the first element to 'a'
print(my_list)  # This should print ['a', 2, 3]



my_string = "cat"

# Attempt to modify a string directly (this line is commented out because it would raise an error if executed):
# my_string[0] = 'b'  # Uncommenting this line would raise a TypeError

# The correct approach to "modify" a string:
new_string = 'b' + my_string[1:]
print(new_string)  # This will print "bat"
